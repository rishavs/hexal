# hexal
A super simple and pragmatic programming language.
Hexal doesn't sets out to chart new frontiers in category theory or 

It is a hybrid OOPS/Procedural/Functional language which should look just familiar to anyone trying it and be super easy to get started with.

Syntactically it is similar to wren/Haxe

You can think of it as 
Wren + Static & Strong Typing + ADTs + Manual Memory Management
